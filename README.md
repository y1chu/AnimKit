# AnimKit
## THIS PROJECT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!
### https://trello.com/b/Knn4z7xZ/animkit
AnimKit is a powerful animation toolkit for Unity that allows smooth and versatile animations and transitions for game objects. It provides a wide range of features, including basic interpolation, easing functions, path animation, color transitions, UI animation, audio animation, sprite animation, event system, timeline editor, animation blending, animation layers, particle system integration, physics animation, and curve editing.

## Features

### Basic Interpolation

- Implement linear interpolation for smooth transitions between different property values.
- Support interpolation for position, rotation, scale, and other common transform properties of game objects.
- Handle different data types appropriately (e.g., Vector3 for position, Quaternion for rotation).

### Easing Functions

- Include a collection of pre-defined easing functions (e.g., ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out) to control the acceleration and deceleration of animations.
- Allow users to define custom easing functions to achieve specific animation effects.
- Provide an intuitive interface for selecting and applying easing functions to animations.

### Path Animation

- Develop a system to define and animate objects along predefined paths or custom curves.
- Support linear, bezier, or spline-based paths for smooth and curved motion.
- Enable customization of path parameters, such as speed, direction, and loop behavior.

### Color Transitions

- Implement interpolation between color values, enabling smooth transitions between different colors.
- Support RGBA and HSLA color spaces for flexible color manipulation.
- Allow users to specify transition durations and easing functions for color animations.

### UI Animation

- Provide functionality to animate UI elements, such as position, scale, rotation, opacity, and color.
- Implement UI-specific easing functions to create visually appealing transitions.
- Support layout animations for dynamic resizing and repositioning of UI elements.

### Audio Animation

- Integrate audio animation capabilities, allowing users to trigger audio effects or manipulate audio properties during animations.
- Enable synchronization of audio playback with animation timeline events or keyframes.
- Provide control over volume, pitch, and other audio parameters.

### Sprite Animation

- Develop a sprite animation system to support frame-based animations or sprite sheet animations.
- Enable users to define animation sequences, frame durations, and looping options.
- Allow for customization of sprite rendering, including flipping, rotation, and pivot points.

### Event System

- Create an event system that allows users to trigger callbacks or custom events at specific points during the animation timeline.
- Support event parameters and data passing for flexible interaction with other systems.
- Enable users to create event sequences to chain complex animations or trigger external actions.

### Timeline Editor

- Design a visual timeline editor or interface for creating and managing complex animations.
- Provide a timeline-based view to arrange animations, keyframes, and events.
- Enable users to adjust timing, durations, and interpolation settings intuitively.

### Animation Blending

- Implement blending techniques to smoothly transition between different animations or animation states.
- Support weighted blending to control the influence of each animation layer.
- Handle animation blending for both skeletal and non-skeletal animations.

### Animation Layers

- Allow users to define and manage multiple animation layers independently.
- Support layer-specific blending and weighting of animations.
- Enable layer control to create complex animation compositions, such as additive animations or overrides.

### Particle System Integration

- Integrate with Unity's particle system to animate particle effects.
- Allow users to control particle properties, such as emission rates, colors, sizes, and shapes.
- Enable timeline-based manipulation of particle system parameters.

### Physics Animation

- Implement physics-based animation capabilities for rigidbody transformations and joint animations.
- Enable users to apply forces, impulses, or constraints during animations to create dynamic motion.
- Ensure synchronization between animation and physics simulation for accurate results.

### Curve Editor

- Develop a curve editor to allow users to define and modify custom curves for animating properties.
- Provide intuitive manipulation of curve tangents and control points.
- Support curve presets and interpolation methods to create smooth and precise animations.
